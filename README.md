## About The Project



<h3 align="center">Overview:</h3> 
This Python script is designed to read and organize pricing information from the TraderPlusPriceConfig.json file, which is used in the DayZ Mod TraderPlus (https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2458896948)



<h3 align="center">Usage:</h3> 

Make sure you have the DayZ Mod TraderPlus installed and have the TraderPlusPriceConfig.json file available.
Download the traderplus_price_sorter.py script from this repository.
Modify the input_file variable in the script to point to the location of your TraderPlusPriceConfig.json file:

After execution, the script will generate a new JSON file named TraderPlusPriceConfig_sorted.json in the same directory as your input file. 
This sorted file will contain the pricing data organized by descending buy price.
